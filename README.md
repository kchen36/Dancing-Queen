## Description

  Teams can create their own dancing formations to their favorite songs. They can. 1 Set of formations = 1 piece and each piece corresponds to 1 song(songs can have multiple pieces). People can work together to create new pieces all from home(assuming they have internet).
  
## User Interface

  People can create teams(making them leader) and they can invite friends into the team. The leader, or members can create a piece/edit a piece (with leader having acess to all pieces inside his/her team). People can edit their own nicknames inside each team they are in.

## Database

Sqlite3 will be used to store all the information

## D3 Feature

  We plan to use SVG for the stage and use transtions as people move from one position to the next. We might include a slider or just a textbox to imput to jump to a selected part of a piece.
